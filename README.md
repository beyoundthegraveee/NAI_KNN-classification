The aim is to write a program that takes the following arguments:
 - K - a positive natural number which is the k-NN parameter.
 - Train-set - the name of the file containing the training set in CSV form.
 - Test-set - the name of the file containing the test set in CSV form.
The programme is to perform a k-NN classification of all observations from the test-set file based on the trainset file, and to provide the accuracy of this classification.
The program is also to provide a test interface (not necessarily graphical) that allows the user to provide individual vectors
for classification and gives their k-NN label based on the trainset. The programme is to be tested on iris data, having been divided into 105 training irises (35 from each class) and 45 test irises.
